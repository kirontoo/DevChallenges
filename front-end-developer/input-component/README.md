<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshots/screenshot.png)

This project was easier than the previous one since it is an improvement from the `button-component project`.
I added some routing to the sidebar so that you can still see the button components and a 404 page.
From this project, I learned how to position icons inside an input without it misaligning in different device widths.
